I mainly work as a project assistant in the [Digital Learning Team (DLT)](http://www.education.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/teaching-learning/create.html) at the Faculty of Education and Social Work, the University of Auckland.



As a project assistant, With an overall aim to improve university teachers' pedagogical use of ICT, my daily job involves the following aspects:

  * Collaborate with learning designers for designated projects and provide advice;

  * Carry out background research with learning designers on relevant projects (e.g., evaluation of collaborative active learning spaces, blended learning, and identification and review of supporting tools);

  * Provide on-site and in-class technical support to DLT staff, academic staff, presenters, mentors, and students for various project-related workshops, classes, and other sessions;

  * Deliver project-related professional development support to meet pre-set objectives (e.g., preparation of easy-to-follow training material and organisation of workshops to train teachers how to use the new learning management system--Canvas).

I am also a research affiliate of the quantitative data analysis and research unit, Faculty of Education and Social Work, University of Auckland. My research interests include educational technology, technology-enhanced language learning, technology acceptance, and teacher education. My current research project focuses on the potential use of AR/VR in the educational context.

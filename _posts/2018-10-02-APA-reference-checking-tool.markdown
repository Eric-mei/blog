What does recite do?
Very simply, Recite checks that your in text citations match the reference list at the end of your work.

First, Recite checks that the authors and dates in the body of your work match up with the references at the end. Then Recite tells you where it finds errors.

Recite also checks for a growing list of stylistic errors related to referencing.

Who is recite for?
Anyone who writes academic essays, articles or books that contain references.

Recite is optimised for those who use APA or Harvard referencing styles.

Recite may be of most use to those who don't use reference management software like Endnote or RefWorks. But even if you do use them, try Recite and let us know what you find.

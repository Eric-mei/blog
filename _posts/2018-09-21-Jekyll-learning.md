Jekyll is really a useful tool to stimulate your interest in blogging.
Additionally, it is also a good starting point for people to realise the pleasure of writing and to delve into the mechanism behind the webpages.

I am currently trying to save the jekyll web structure on my dropbox so that I can work on my blogging in my office and push it online at home.

During my quest, I found Atom (https://atom.io/) is really handy for me to work on my first jekyll project. Like it till now.

Wish me good luck!
